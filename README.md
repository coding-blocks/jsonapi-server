A resource driven framework to set up a {json:api} + GraphQL endpoint in record time. 

## Motivation

Let us look at these great articles written by some very experiences developers - 

 1. [Phil Sturgeon says if you use json:api you do not need GraphQL](https://blog.runscope.com/posts/you-might-not-need-graphql)
 2. [Bill Doerrfeld writes about the benefits of json:api](https://nordicapis.com/the-benefits-of-using-json-api/)
 3. [Jorge says json:api is a simple alternative to GraphQL](https://react-etc.net/entry/json-api-is-a-simple-alternative-to-graphql-and-rest)
 4. [Jeremy Sherman says he is not impressed by json:api and GraphQL is better](https://jeremywsherman.com/blog/2016/07/23/why-im-meh-about-json-api/)
 5. [Brandur says GraphQL is the next frontier in Web Developement](https://brandur.org/api-paradigms)

If you ask me, I'd say -

And in fact, some of the most used public APIs like Github have both REST and GraphQL.

**jagql** lets you build a backend with both `{json:api}` and _GraphQL_ support really really fast. 


## About this Fork
**NOTE: This is a fork of holidayextra's [jsonapi-server](https://github.com/holidayextras/jsonapi-server)
We have merged a lot of pending PRs on the original repo that we felt we would gain advantage from. The original project
was coing a bit too slowly for our needs.**

### Differences from upstream

#### `primaryKey` is configurable
In upstream, keys are by default `uuid` and are taken from DB, if `generateId` = `true`
We instead use a different property `primaryKey`, whose possible values are

 - `uuid` : Uses UUID v4 (generated from the client)
 - `autoincrement` : Uses AUTOINCREMENT integers

\*In future there might be other types of primaryKeys if required.

#### relationship key type is configurable
When creating a field, you can state how to relate it

```javascript
jsonApi.define({
  ... 
  attributes: {
    ... 
    author: jsonApi.Joi.one('people').uidType('uuid')
    ...
  }
})
```

_**You'd want to use our version of jsonapi-store-\[\*\] plugins with this
as the original versions will not be compatible with this**_

_The old readme [here](README-old.md) is verbatim copy of the original project_
